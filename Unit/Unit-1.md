# Introduction

## Defination of Software
-------------------------

``Software`` is the collection of computer programs, procedures and documentation that performs different task on computer system. 

At a very basic level, computer software consists of a machine language tahat consist of group of binary values, which specify processor instruction. The processor instruction changes the state of computer hardware in a predefined sequence. Briefy, computer software is a language which computer speaks.

## Types of Software
-------------------------

Types of ``Software`` are:

- ``System Software``
    - Operating System
    - Utility Software
    - Language Processor
        - Compiler
        - Interpeter
        - Assembler
- ``Application Software``
    - Package Software
    - Tailored Software

**Explanation:**

### **``System Software:``**
``System software`` is computer software designed to operate the computer hardware and to provide a platform for running application softwares.It helps in running computer hardware and the computer system. System software is a collection of operating systems, device drivers, servers, windowing systems and utilities. ``System software`` helps an application programmer in viewing away from hardware, memory and other internal complexities of a computer. Some common types of system software are given below:

#### Operating System:

An ``Operating System (OS)`` is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.

An ``Operating System (OS)`` is a large collection of system software, which manages the resources of computer system such as ``memory``, ``storage``, ``processor``, ``I/O devices`` and it also acts as an interface between machine and user. Moreover, it also performs the basic tasks such as reorganization of peripherial devices, sending-recieving information to the external sources keeping task of files, folders on the disk and other different utility task.

#### **Utility Software:**

``Utility Software`` help manage, maintain and control computer resources. These programs are available to help you with the day-to-day chores associated with personal computing and to keep your system running at peak performance.

#### **Language Processor:**

It is a special type of computer system software that can used to translate program in one language into another language. It is most compulsory for ``low level language`` and ``high level language``. Types of language translator are: 

- **``Compiler:``** It is a language translator program which translate ``high level language program`` into ``machine level program`` at single attempt.

- **``Interpeter:``** It is a language translator program which translate ``high level language`` program into ``machine level`` one instruction at a time.

- **``Assembler:``** It is a language translator program which translate ``assembly language program`` into ``machine level program``.

### **``Application Software:``**

Application software is developed in order to fulfill user requirements. It enables user to accomplish certain specific task. It can useto solve application type of problems. Business software, Database software, and educational software are some forms of application software. Other application software is word processors, spreadsheet ,presentation packages etc. ``Application software`` utilizes the capacity of a computer directly to a dedicated task.

#### **Package Software:**

``Package software`` are generally made by software companies to generalize the tasks. They are general purpose software. Some common types of package software are ``Word Processing Software``, ``Database Software``, ``Spreadsheet Software``, ``Multimedia Software``, ``Presentation Software`` etc. 

#### **Tailored Software:**

``Tailored software`` is specific purpose software software. It is also called small type of software. These types of software are developed for specific task. They are written in high level languages such as ``JAVA``, ``C``, ``C++``, ``Python`` etc. Examples are ``banking software``, ``hospital software``, ``hospital reservation software``, ``billing software`` etc.

## Characteristic of Software
-----------------------------------

Software Characteristics are classified into six major components: 

- ``Functionality``
- ``Reliability``
- ``Efficiency``
- ``Usability``
- ``Maintainability``
- ``Portability``

These components are described below: 

### **``Functionality``**

It refers to the degree of performance of the software against its intended purpose. 

Required functions are:

- Suitability
- Accuracy
- Interoperability
- Compliance
- Security

### **``Reliability``**

A set of attributes that bears on the capability of software to maintain its level of performance under the given condition for a stated period of time. 

Required functions are: 

- Recoverability
- Fault tolerance
- Maturity

### **``Efficiency``**

It refers to the ability of the software to use system resources in the most effective and efficient manner. The software should make effective use of storage space and executive command as per desired timing requirements. 

Required functions are: 

- In Time
- In Resource

### **``Usability``**

It refers to the extent to which the software can be used with ease. the amount of effort or time required to learn how to use the software. 

Required functions are: 

- Understandability
- Learnability
- Operability

### **``Maintainability``**

It refers to the ease with which the modifications can be made in a software system to extend its functionality, improve its performance, or correct errors. 

Required functions are:

- Testabilty
- Stability
- Changabilty
- Operability

### **``Portability``**

A set of attributes that bears on the ability of software to be transferred from one environment to another, without or minimum changes. 

Required functions are:

- Adaptability
- Installability
- Replaceability

```C
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {    

    int number1, number2, sum;
    
    printf("Enter two integers: ");
    scanf("%d %d", &number1, &number2);

    // calculating sum
    sum = number1 + number2;      
    
    printf("%d + %d = %d", number1, number2, sum);
    return 0;
}

```
